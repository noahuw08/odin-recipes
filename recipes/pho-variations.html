            Possible variations for Pho
        </h1>
        <h2>These are a few ways in case you want to customize your Pho noodle soup:</h2>
        
        <div class="variety">
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="point">Use pre-cooked steak:</strong> If you prefer not to cook the steak in the individual serving
                    <p>bowls, feel free to instead stir the steak directly into the stockpot of simmering </p>
                    <p>broth to ensure that it is fully cooked. Then ladle the broth and beef together into</p>
                    <p>the individual serving bowls.</p>
                </li>

                <br><li><strong class="point">Use a different protein:</strong> Pho bo is traditionally made with beef, but feel free to use
                    <p>a different protein in place of the thinly-sliced steak if you prefer, such as chicken, </p>
                    <p>pork, shrimp or tofu.</p>
                </li>

                <br><li><strong class="point">Use ground (instead of whole) spices:</strong> I really recommend using whole spices for
                    <p>this recipe if you can. But in a pinch, feel free to substitute their ground</p>
                    <p>equivalents. Those substitutions would roughly be: 2 1/2 teaspoons ground star</p>
                    <p>anise, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, pinch of </p>
                    <p>ground cardamom, 2 teaspoons ground coriander.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>cooker), first use the “sauté” setting to char the onions and ginger. Then add in the</p>
                    <p>spices and stock. Cover, seal, and cook (manual high pressure) for 10 minutes,</p>
                    <p>followed by a quick release. Add in the remaining ingredients as directed in the</p>

                    <p>you would like, then add them to the Crock-Pot.)  Cover and cook on high for 3</p>
                    <p>hours or on low for 6 hours*. Add in the remaining ingredients as directed in the</p>

                    <p><em>*If it seems that much of the broth has evaporated while cooking, just add in a</em></p>

                <p>the beef stock from scratch, I recommend trying <a class="link" href="https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2008/10/pho-beef-noodle-soup.html">this recipe</a>.</p>

                    <p>teaspoon in along with the other spices for extra flavor.</p>
