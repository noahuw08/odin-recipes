            How to make Pho soup:
        </h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the protein.</strong> In order to slice the beef, chicken or pork as thinly as possible, 
                <p>I recommend popping the meat in the freezer for at least 30-45 minutes to chill.</p> 
                <p>Then use a sharp knife to thinly slice the meat before adding it to the soup.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Make the broth.</strong> Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling, char the onion and ginger
                <p>(either in a skillet or under the broiler). Meanwhile, briefly toast the spices in a</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00U00JU6A/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=gs2&linkId=40c6f68c28ad6230cbb88b8c31cc3777&creativeASIN=B00U00JU6A&tag=gimmesomeov07-20&creative=9325">large stockpot</a>. Then add in the onion, ginger, and broth. Cover and let everything</p>
                <p>simmer together for at least 30 minutes so that all of those flavors can meld. </p>
                <p>Strain out and discard all of the onions, ginger and spices. Then stir in the</p>
                <p>remaining ingredients and season with salt.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prep the noodles.</strong> Meanwhile, as your broth is simmering, go ahead and cook the
                <p>noodles al dente according to the package instructions. Drain in a strainer, then</p>
                <p>toss briefly with cold water to prevent the noodles from continuing to cook, and </p>
                <p>set aside. (I also recommend tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil — such as</p>
                <p>sesame oil — to prevent them from sticking.)</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Assemble.</strong> Once everything is ready to go, add a handful of noodles to each 
                <p>individual serving bowl, topped with your desired protein. Then ladle the</p>
                <p>simmering hot broth into the serving bowls, being sure to submerge the meat so</p>
                <p>that it will get cooked. Top with lots and lots of garnishes.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Serve.</strong>And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir the garnishes into the soup
                <p>so that they can flavor the broth, also adding in additional extra sauces if desired.</p>
            </li>
