        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is the proper “pho” pronunciation? </strong>The closest way to write the correct phở
                <p>pronunciation with English characters is “fuh.” But Vietnamese is a tonal language,</p>
                <p>so the correct pronunciation requires lifting the pitch, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5uNyrGC3EE">this</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Where and when did pho originate?</strong> Pho originated in Vietnam, likely sometime
                <p>during the early 1900s. Historians disagree about the exact origins of the dish and</p>
                <p>its etymology, but it was likely influenced in large part by other similar noodle </p>
                <p>dishes as well as the increased availability of beef due to its demand by French</p>
                <p>colonialists. In the years since, countless variations of the dish have become</p>
                <p>traditional in various regions of Vietnam, and it is now officially regarded as</p>
                <p>Vietnam's national dish.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>How do you serve pho?</strong> Pho soup is traditionally served in large soup bowls with
                <p>chopsticks and a soup spoon. But that said, feel free to use whatever bowls you</p>
                <p>happen to have on hand at home.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>How exactly are you supposed to eat pho?</strong> First, use your chopsticks to stir all of
                <p>those yummy fresh garnishes into the broth to help give it extra flavor. (You can</p>
                <p>later pick them out if you don't want to eat stems, chiles, etc.)  Then alternately,</p>
                <p>use your chopsticks to eat the noodles, protein and veggies, while using your spoon</p>
                <p>to eat the broth. I've read that in Vietnam, it's also encouraged to lift up your bowl</p>
                <p>to drink the last of the broth, if you would like.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Is pho gluten-free?</strong> Yes, this pho soup recipe is naturally gluten-free. (As always
                <p>though, just be sure to double-check that all of your ingredients are certified GF.)</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>s the meat in pho fully cooked?</strong> If the meat is very thinly sliced, the broth is
                <p>boiling hot, and the meat is completely submerged in the broth right away — then</p>
                <p>yes, the meat should be fully cooked. That said, if you want to be doubly sure that</p>
                <p>your meat is fully cooked, see instructions above for cooking the meat in the hot</p>
                <p>stockpot of broth and then adding it to the individual serving bowls.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Is pho traditionally made with beef broth?</strong> Yes, pho is traditionally made with beef
                <p>broth. But there are many different variations on pho that can be made with</p>
                <p>different broths and different kinds of proteins.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Make ahead instructions?</strong> Nearly all of the components of this recipe can be
                <p>prepped in advance if you would like (which would make this recipe even easier if</p>
                <p>serving it to a big group). For example, the noodles and broth can be prepared and</p>
                <p>then refrigerated (separately) in sealed containers until ready to reheat and serve.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Storage instructions?</strong> I recommend refrigerating the broth, protein, noodles and
                <p>garnishes in separate containers, so that the noodles do not soak up all of the</p>
                <p>broth. But the cooked soup (with the ingredients stored separately or mixed</p>
                <p>together) can be refrigerated in sealed containers for up to 3 days.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
